# AirBnB_clone
**0x00. AirBnB clone - The console**

This project is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

Each task is linked in the below ways:

* Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.

* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.

* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel.

* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
